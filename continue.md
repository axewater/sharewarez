# Continue: Test Database Configuration Issue

## Current Status
We successfully created comprehensive unit tests for `modules/utils_processors.py` in the file `tests/test_utils_processors.py`. All 15 tests are passing.

## Critical Issue Discovered
The tests are currently targeting the **production database** (`sharewarez`) instead of a separate test database. This is dangerous and violates testing best practices.

### Evidence:
- Database URI shows: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/sharewarez` (production)
- No `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set
- App initialization during tests modifies the production database
- While transaction rollback prevents data persistence, the risk remains

## What Was Accomplished
✅ Created `tests/test_utils_processors.py` with comprehensive coverage:
- **TestGetLoc Class**: 6 tests covering file operations, UTF-8 handling, error cases
- **TestGetGlobalSettings Class**: 9 tests covering database operations, settings merging, edge cases
- All tests follow SharewareZ patterns with proper mocking and transaction rollback
- 15/15 tests passing

## What Needs To Be Done Next
1. **Set up proper test database configuration**:
   - Create a separate test database (e.g., `sharewarez_test`)
   - Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Or update conftest.py to override database URI for tests

2. **Verify test isolation**:
   - Re-run tests to ensure they use the test database
   - Confirm no impact on production data

## Files Modified
- ✅ `tests/test_utils_processors.py` - Created comprehensive test file
- All tests use proper patterns: `db_session.execute(delete(GlobalSettings))` for isolation

## Next Steps After Test DB Setup
1. Verify tests run against test database
2. Confirm all 15 tests still pass
3. Optional: Add coverage reporting
4. Document the testing approach

The test file itself is complete and follows all SharewareZ testing patterns correctly. The only issue is the database target configuration.
