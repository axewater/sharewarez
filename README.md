## 🐳 Docker Install

**Quick Docker Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/axewater/sharewarez.git
cd sharewarez

# Copy and configure environment file
cp .env.docker.example .env
# Edit .env file with your game directory path:
# DATA_FOLDER_WAREZ=/path/to/your/games

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

**What it includes:**
- ✅ Complete PostgreSQL database setup
- ✅ Automatic application configuration
- ✅ Persistent data storage
- ✅ Ready-to-use on port 5006

**Step-by-step:**
1. Clone repository and navigate to folder
2. Copy `.env.docker.example` to `.env`
3. Edit `.env` file - set `DATA_FOLDER_WAREZ` to your games directory
4. Run `docker-compose up -d`
5. Open browser to `http://localhost:5006`
6. Complete setup wizard and create admin account

**Management commands:**
```bash

docker-compose down

# Update to latest version
git pull && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build

# Reset database (if needed)
docker-compose exec web /app/startweb-docker.sh --force-setup
```

---

## 🔧 Post-Installation

**Database Reset (if needed):**
- Linux: `./startweb.sh --force-setup`
- Windows: `.\startweb_windows.cmd --force-setup`

**Updating SharewareZ:**
1. Stop the application (Ctrl+C)
2. `git pull` → `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Restart with startup script

**Troubleshooting:**
- Port 5006 in use: Change port in startup script or set PORT environment variable
- Database errors: Check PostgreSQL is running and credentials are correct
- Linux permissions: Ensure read access to game directories

## 🔧 Additional Settings
- 🌐 Default port: `5006` (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- 👥 Go the admin dashboard for further configuration

## 🌐 Changing the Port Number

SharewareZ runs on port `5006` by default. To change this:

**For Linux/Windows installations:**
1. Edit your `.env` file
2. Add or modify: `PORT=8080` (replace 8080 with your desired port)
3. Restart SharewareZ

**For Docker installations:**
- Docker containers always use port `5006` internally
- The external port is mapped via docker-compose.yml (also defaults to 5006)
- To change external port, edit the `ports` section in docker-compose.yml

**Examples:**
```bash
# In .env file - run on port 8080
PORT=8080

# In .env file - run on port 3000
PORT=3000
```

## 🔧 Supported platforms to play in browser
