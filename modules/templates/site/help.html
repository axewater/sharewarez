                - You can browse the games library using filters, or search<br>
                - Just type to start searching<br>
                - Downloads are not 'direct downloads', you pick a game and queue it for downloading. The server will prepare a ZIP file for downloading.<br>

                <br>
                <h2>ADMIN TIPS :</h2>

                <br>
                - Use auto folder scanner to scan your games folders<br>
                - Folder scanning will take all subfolders of given path and try to add each of them as games to the library<br>
                - Do not start second job before first one is done<br>
                - You can add any folder your server has access to<br>
                - Game names are automatically cleaned<br>
                - Check unmatched folder manager after scanning is done<br>
